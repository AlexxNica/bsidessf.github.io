Interested in helping at BSides SF 2016?

As a community-driven event, BSides SF would not be possible without the work of volunteers. The organizers have worked hard to build a fun and exciting agenda. In order to execute this event and make it successful, we seeking additional volunteers to help with the tasks on the two days of the event (February 28-29, 2016), which include, but are not limited to:

* Registration / Information
* Audio/Visual
* Room moderators / security
* Speaker wrangling
* Top secret undercover missions

We understand that our volunteers want to hear some of the talks as well, and we will work with you to ensure you are able to do so.

You can sign up to be a volunteer [here](/volunteer.html).
