We're happy to introduce our two keynote speakers:

Jason Truppi, career technologist turned FBI agent and now tech entrepreneur, will be sharing illusions and realities he saw both in the field and in Silicon Valley. 

Robert Wood, who runs the security and compliance teams at Nuna, will explore strategies that security teams and leaders can use to balance bureaucracy, compliance, and politics to achieve the security goals theyâ€™re striving for.
